# New way to print Hello World in Java
A new innovative way to print `Hello world!` to the standard output in Java. Sick of directly printing the string `Hello world!`? This new method got you covered!

See the [the code](src/main/java/net/shadew/test/HelloWorldGenerator.java) to learn how it works!

## Features
- A nice way to print the string `"Hello world!"` to the standard output (`System.out`).
- Localisation for furries included, you may enable this by adding the `furry` argument when running your program. When enabled, it will instead print `Henlo world UwU~`.
